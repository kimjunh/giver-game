Private Games
------------

A private game will have url of /games/play/<4 byte random string>
They will be not be listed on the "all" games page.

Creation
if not private:
    Save everything as before, no changes
else:
    game.is_private = true
    game.private_id = new random string(4 bytes)
    game.save()
    flash[:notice] += "New private game url: /games/play/<private_id>"



Access:
If you try to go to a private game's actual id (i.e. /games/play/:id),
the controller should check if the game to be rendered is_private. If so, display 404.

If you go to /games/play/<private_id>, the controller will take :id to mean private_id
ex) if game doesn't exist with :id, try looking for a private game where private_id == :id.
If no match on either, show 404.
If match for :id but game is private, show 404
If match for private_id == :id and game is private, render that game as the game and play as normal.
