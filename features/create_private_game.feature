Feature: Create private game
    As a game creator
    I want to create private games
    So that only my friends can vote on which charity my money goes towards
Background:

  Given the following games exist:
  | title       | description                                | per_transaction | charityA_title | charityB_title |
  | First game  | something something                        |      10         | A charity      | what           |
  | Second game | something something else                   |      1          | Another one    | cold           |

  Given the following users exist:
  | username           | password   | password_confirmation  |     email             |
  | Traitor_JOSEPHINE   | TRAITORJOE |  TRAITORJOE            |  j0e@tr8er.org        |
 
  Scenario: Create the third (private) game
    Given I am logged in as "j0e@tr8er.org" with password "TRAITORJOE"
    When I am on the new games page
    And I fill out the form with values "Title": "Secret New Game","Description": "Descriptive description to describe","TotalMoney": "100","AmountPerVote": "10","Charity A": "Give Directly","DescriptionA": "Provides money directly to groups of impoverished people.","Charity B": "Malaria Nets","DescriptionB": "Provides malaria nets to locals."
    Then the "private_game" radio button should be chosen
    And I press "Submit New Game"
    Then I should be on the home page
    And I should see "Giving Game Secret New Game successfully created. Private link: http://"
    When I go to the existing games page
    Then I should not see "Secret New Game"
    Then I should see only "2" games
    When I go to the user page for "j0e@tr8er.org"
    Then I should see "Secret New Game"
    Then I should see "Public" appear "0" times
    Then I should see "Private" appear "1" time
    Then I should see "Link: http://" appear "1" time
